There are some issues that are draining the battery of your Android smartphone very quickly.  And all of these things are the same for all devices, not just one.  If you ever suffer from battery malnutrition on your smartphone, just sit back and watch us and see what's happening here.

 <h3>Display Brightness:</h3>

No wonder the display of your favorite device but the first level eater in terms of battery destruction.  The main reason for this is to increase the brightness of the display.  The Auto Brightness program does the same thing.  The simple solution is to use as little brightness as you can and increase it as needed.  If you use your device in this way then there are endless surprises for you at least in terms of battery.


 <h3>Location:</h3>

 If you are a courier service or pizza delivery person then no problem with you.  And if not, don't sit down and talk.  Probably there is no need to keep GPS on our smartphone 24 hours a day.  Turning on GPS will start your phone's battery joke.  So don't say don't use GPS.  Use it when needed and turn it off again.  Only then will you understand how BD-Droid treats you.  Display time-out: Display time-out is a special type of option where you can determine how long your phone will stay awake without you.  That means when your phone goes into sleep mode when you turn off navigation.  If you take too much time, it will discharge your phone battery very quickly.  It is best if you use 15 seconds or 30 seconds.

 <h3>Account Suncing:</h3>

 A link to the Play Store is created when your phone is connected to a Google Account.  One of the main tasks is to update your downloaded apps.  In this case, if you turn off Auto Update and turn on Manual Update, you will be protected from Internet connectivity at any time.  And with it you will get your much desired battery life for free.


 Wi-Fi seating (Wi-fi connectivity):

 Since the smartphone in your hand.  So if you get Wi-Fi, you will not be able to control yourself anymore.  I won't even tell you to restrain.  But I will just say that when you are done, you will turn off the Wi-Fi immediately.  And refrain from using weak connections as much as possible.  If you want, you can avoid weak connections from your phone's Wi-Fi settings.


 <h3>NFC, Gestures, profile:</h3>

 Although I like NFC very much but to be honest it is very complicated to use.  So I say don't use this option if you don't need it very much.  And always try to use power saving mode from profile.  Power saving mode will automatically handle your battery care.  But why use it?


 Old and unused apps:

 When I first used my Android phone, I had about 200 apps on my phone, most of which I wouldn't open in a month.  As a result, the battery of the phone began to betray me.  So I'm telling you to say goodbye to everyone except your useful apps as much as possible from your phone.  And I almost forgot to mention that when you get an updated version of the apps you use, you will update it if you can.  Because the one thing that always comes to the minds of developers is how to work with less battery.  So updated versions are always welcome.  I talked a lot about batteries.  I hope you can enjoy the joy of smartphone more.
